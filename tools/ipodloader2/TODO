TODO:
* Make FAT32 use DOS-convention filenames instead of on-disk encoding
* Similarly, make FAT32 support LFNs
* Make PP5002 compatible
* Reduce BSS segment size


Notes about TODOs:
* Make FAT32 use DOS.....
  Replace ' ' with 0x0, and do two strncmp() on each dirent, and
  is should pretty much work already. Make case-insensitive for
  niceness
* Reduce BSS segment size
  FAT32 has a "clusterBuffer" that should be mlc_malloc()'ed instead
  Make mlc_malloc() allocate mem from MAX_MEM and down
* Make PP5002 compatible
  mlc_malloc() needs to be adjusted for the different RAM mapping
  The entry-point is different from the PP502x's
  Support more LCDs: 4G B&W, 4G Color, 4G Photo, Nano, 5G
