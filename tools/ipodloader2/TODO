Known:
	We're executing in IRAM (0x80000000)
	IRAM is 96KB
	Framebuffer size: 77440 bytes (220*176*2)
	Memory footprint: 89250 bytes
	Stack position  : 96252 bytes into IRAM

Figure out:
	Where is SDRAM located?

TODO:
	Implement one-shot malloc() that handles SDRAM
	Reduce BSS from 77528 bytes to <1KB
	Compile with -fomit-frame-pointer
